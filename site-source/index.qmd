## Welcome!

### About the workshop

Computer-generated artwork has been around for quite a while. The idea of using R for this purpose, however, is a little more recent. Designed originally as a programming language for academic statistical computing, R is now a mainstream language for data science and analytics. Can it also work as an artistic medium? Is there an overlap between our familiar data science workflows and the artistic process? Perhaps we can become better data scientists through art, and vice versa.

This workshop provides a hands-on introduction to generative art in R. You’ll learn artistic techniques that generative artists use regularly in their work including flow fields, iterative function systems, and more. You’ll also learn about R packages specialised for generative art. But more than that, you’ll learn how to reuse skills you already have as part of an artistic process: with a little work, ggplot2, dplyr, and Rcpp can become an artist's best friends. The assumed background is that you’re reasonably comfortable using R and RStudio, and have experience with tidyverse. 

### About the instructor

Danielle Navarro is a generative artist, data scientist, professional educator, mathematical psychologist, academic professor in recovery, open source R developer, and coauthor of "ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis" (3rd edition). She is currently a developer advocate at Voltron Data working with the Apache Arrow ecosystem. You can find her art at [art.djnavarro.net](https://art.djnavarro.net), and other professional details at [djnavarro.net](https://djnavarro.net). Danielle lives in Sydney, Australia with her two children and her Netflix subscription.
